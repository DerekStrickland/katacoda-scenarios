HashiCorp Consul Service (HCS) on Azure enables Microsoft Azure users to natively
provision HashiCorp-managed Consul servers in any supported Azure region directly
through the Azure Marketplace. As a fully managed service, HCS on Azure lowers the
barrier to entry for an organization to leverage Consul for service discovery or
service mesh across a mix of VM, hybrid/on-premises, and Kubernetes environments
while offloading the operational burden to the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
experts at HashiCorp.


In this hands-on lab, you:

- Deployed an instance of HashiCorp Consul Service on Azure.
- Learned the available configuration options for the servers.
- Interacted with your Consul service using the Consul UI.
- Retrieved HCS on Azure data including server connection information, Consul agent configuration, and Consul certificates.
- Deployed a Consul service mesh on an AKS cluster and connected it to an instance of a HCS on Azure.
- Deployed a demo application to AKS and verified it was registered with Consul service mesh.
